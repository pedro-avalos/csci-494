						 created Sci-Hub in 2011 as a 22-year-old graduate student in Kazakhstan, Science
						 addresses some basic questions: Who are Sci-Hub's users, where are they, and what are
						 they reading? The Sci-Hub data provide the first detailed view of what is becoming the
						 world's de facto open-access research library. Among the revelations that may surprise
						 both fans and foes alike: Sci-Hub users are not limited to the developing world. Some
						 critics of Sci-Hub have complained that many users can access the same papers through
						 their libraries but turn to Sci-Hub instead—for convenience rather than necessity. The
						 data provide some support for that claim. Over the 6 months leading up to March,
						 Sci-Hub served up 28 million documents, with Iran, China, India, Russia, and the United
						 States the leading requestors.},

	abstract = {The number of trojans, worms, and viruses that computers encounter varies greatly
						 across countries. Empirically identifying factors behind such variation can provide a
						 scientific empirical basis to policy actions to reduce malware encounters in the most
						 affected countries. However, our understanding of these factors is currently mainly
						 based on expert opinions, not empirical evidence.In this paper, we empirically test
						 alternative hypotheses about factors behind international variation in the number of
						 trojan, worm, and virus encounters. We use the Symantec Anti-Virus (AV) telemetry data
						 collected from more than 10 million Symantec customer computers worldwide that we
						 accessed through the Symantec Worldwide Intelligence Environment (WINE) platform. We
						 use regression analysis to test for the effect of computing and monetary resources, web
						 browsing behavior, computer piracy, cyber security expertise, and international
						 relations on international variation in malware encounters.We find that trojans, worms,
						 and viruses are most prevalent in Sub-Saharan African countries. Many Asian countries
						 also encounter substantial quantities of malware. Our regression analysis reveals that
						 the main factor that explains high malware exposure of these countries is a widespread
						 computer piracy especially when combined with poverty. Our regression analysis also
						 reveals that, surprisingly, web browsing behavior, cyber security expertise, and
						 international relations have no significant effect.},
