	abstract = {"All of the known universe is governed solely by books," Voltaire asserted, looking back at the end of his life on the battles he had fought against prejudice, ignorance, and injustice. The Enlightenment as a whole was driven by the power of books. Yet under the Ancien Régime, the book trade was encumbered by conditions that would seem impossible today. There was no liberty of the press, no copyright, no royalties, no returns, and no limited liability. There were virtually no authors who lived from their pens, very few banks, and very little money-none, in fact, that took the form of paper bills guaranteed as legal specie by the state. How could books become such a force under such conditions? This book is meant to explain their power by showing how the publishing industry operated. It explores the ways that publishers behaved--their modes of thought and their strategies for translating intellectual capital into commercial value. Of course, the power of books lay primarily in their contents: the crack of Voltaire's wit, the grip of Rousseau's passion, the audacity of Diderot's thought experiments have rightly won recognition at the heart of literary history. But that history has not taken adequate account of the middlemen who brought literature to readers. Publishers played a decisive role at the juncture where literary, political, and economic history flowed into each other" -- Provided by publisher.},

Specifically, it examines how social and ethical orientations and attitudes towards downloading impact on downloading intentions. The neutralisation theory and theory of planned behaviour are used to underpin the research framework. The data analysis of 284 usable responses produced several significant relationships. Facilitating conditions, social factors, collectivism, and personal moral obligation were found to predict attitudes towards 'illegal' downloading. Social factors, collectivism, personal moral obligation, and attitudes towards 'illegal' downloading were also found to influence intentions to download. The findings derived from this study will provide marketers and policymakers with strategic and managerial initiatives to counteract this persistent problem.},

Delivered in the fresh and exciting prose of a scholar emerging triumphantly from the archives, Spoo offers a perspective that alters our perceptions of modernist authorship and production, asking us to rethink copyright in the present day, and fundamentally reframing some of modernism's canonical heroes. He reveals James Joyce's self-righteous and opportunistic campaign to crush the reputation of irreverent, yet well-intentioned Samuel Roth, pirate ofUlysses, while Roth — small-time publisher and promoter of what Spoo calls “libidinous confections of the avant-garde” (11) — emerges as a not-to-be-forgotten protagonist. In between is Pound, key theorist of copyright reform, who refuses to sign the protest against Roth and testify against him.},

@article{ZellerChristian2008Ftgt,
	abstract = {The increasing power of concentrated financial capital is accompanied by an extension of processes of commodification and procedures of dispossession similar to forms of original accumulation. This continuing and reinforced accumulation by dispossession in its different guises is capital's answer to the problem of over-accumulation. As a form of dispossessing accumulation, the implementation and extension of intellectual property monopolies is of particular importance. In the context of an increasing socialization of labor, in particular of innovative activities, the private appropriation of knowledge in the form of intellectual property monopolies and its commercial valorization has become a central characteristic of the current configuration of capitalism. Income based on such property titles has become an important form of the appropriation of resources in the finance-dominated accumulation regime. The article applies Marxian rent theory to intellectual property monopolies. Findings from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries illustrate how, based on specific power relations, the owners of property titles can appropriate resources and values. Rent extraction processes take place on different scales, from the enforcement of property monopolies over gene sequences to the role of the USA as a rentier state on a global scale.},

This book brings together leading scholars from a variety of disciplines to address that question. Scholars have given surprisingly little attention to assessing how the central Christian ethical category of love - agape - might impact the way we understand law. This book aims to fill that gap by investigating the relationship between agape and law in Scripture, theology, and jurisprudence, as well as applying these insights to contemporary debates in criminal law, tort law, elder law, immigration law, corporate law, intellectual property, and international relations. At a time when the discourse between Christian and other world views is more likely to be filled with hate than love, the implications of agape for law are crucial"-- Provided by publisher.},

						 This paper analyzes how changing the expected length of
						 intellectual property (IP) protection affects economic growth and
						 the welfare of rich and poor consumers. The analysis is based on a
						 product-variety model with non-homothetic preferences and
						 endogenous markups in which, in accordance with empirical
						 evidence, rich households consume a larger variety of goods than
						 poorer ones. It is shown that growth is independent of when there
						 is perfect equality and that can only substantially affect growth
						 when there is a sufficient degree of inequality. When there is
						 inequality, an increase in that is applied to both new and
						 previously granted innovations increases growth. A reduction in
						 that affects only new, but not previously granted innovations, can
						 increase growth if wealth inequality is sufficiently high. In the
						 case where increasing increases growth, poorer households prefer a
						 shorter length of protection than richer ones.},
