\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background Information}

\begin{displayquote}
  \textins That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the
    moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been
    peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible
    over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we
    breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive
    appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.  Thomas
    Jefferson ~\cite{barlow:wine}
\end{displayquote}
It is generally accepted that piracy is an illegal activity, but what is often overlooked
is the legitimate role that piracy plays in a variety of contexts. When it comes to
subverting oppressive regimes, for instance, the tools that piracy provides are
indispensable and for protecting the interests of consumers from predatory business
practices, the abilities of piracy are unmatched. 

Needless to say, with every unregulated system comes abuse and piracy is no exception.
On top of that, piracy, on an individual level, is extremely difficult to combat because
of the immaterial nature of the items that would need to be protected. Ideas flow freely
between people especially when the Internet is involved, so stopping this flow becomes an
exponentially more difficult problem the more people have the restricted data. The ease
with which ideas propagate lead people like Thomas Jefferson to claim that they are
``incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.'' Consequently, two parties form:
those that support piracy for its free and open spread of all information and those that
see piracy as a threat to the further advancement of technology and ideas.

Before proceeding further into the issue of piracy, it is important to have a grasp of
what piracy means insofar as how this paper interprets it. The dictionary defines piracy
as ``the unauthorized use of another's production, invention, or conception especially in
infringement of a copyright.'' While this covers the technical definition of piracy, this
paper elects to utilize a more wholistic definition. Piracy not only includes the
unauthorized use of someone's work, but it includes the tools and techniques that are
commonly used to accomplish this task such as torrent trackers, VPNs, and torrent clients.

As a Christian, how should one approach such a tool and how can it be utilized for the
betterment of God's kingdom? In the paper that follows, piracy will be analyzed through a
number of lenses, culminating in a Christian response to this issue. In doing so, the hope
is that the reader attains a fresh, wholistic understanding of the potential value of
piracy.

\subsection{Thesis/Argument}

Piracy should not be hastily thrown aside.
Piracy is an excellent tool for disseminating information, services, content,
\&c. that may not have been available any other way.

\section{Arguments For Piracy}
As mentioned above, even though piracy is illegal, there is still merit to the tools of
piracy and the values behind them. The merits of piracy can be divided into three realms:
equal access to information, governance, and privacy. 
\subsection{Equal Access}
At its core, piracy is primarily concerned with accessing information of all kinds,
regardless of whether someone is authorized to access that information or not. This is
what piracy is best at and, contrary to popular belief, it is not always a bad thing. 

Take the restricted access to academic journal articles, for instance. Many academic
journals require all readers to pay not an insignificant sum to access research articles
that could contain insight that is valuable to the human race as a whole. Because of the
high cost of entry, certain groups are automatically excluded from reading and building
upon the research that has already been done. John Barlow puts the situation eloquently in
\textit{Selling Wine Without Bottles: The Economy of the Mind on the Global Net} when he
says, \textcquote{barlow:wine}{I am not comfortable with a model which will restrict
inquiry to the wealthy.} In the case of academic journal articles, why shouldn't anyone be
able to better themselves by consuming quality research articles? All humans should be
allowed to continue to learn more about God's creation without being bound by their
financial status. Just as how someone can go to the library and checkout any book that
tickles their fancy, they should be freely able to learn from the ongoing research of our
world. Of course one should recognize that not all information is safe or helpful to be
freely available on the internet, but that is a topic for a later section.

A more concrete instance of where paywalls can be directly harmful to the human race is
with regards to medical research. Till et al. stresses how important access to medical
research is in their article \textit{Who is pirating medical literature? A bibliometric
review of 28 million Sci-Hub downloads}. \blockcquote{till:medical-literature} {Access to
the medical literature is essential for both the practice of evidence-based medicine and
meaningful contribution to medical sciences. Nonetheless, only 12\% of newly published
papers are freely accessible online, and, as of 2014, only 3 million of the 26.3 million
articles indexed on PubMed were available on the site's repository of free materials,
PubMed Central. Access to paywall-protected literature remains primarily through
institutional subscriptions. Such subscriptions are costly and many struggle to afford
access. The result is a disparity in access to the medical literature, particularly for
those in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).}
According to Till et al. the high subscription cost to access medical journal articles
means that those in less advantaged countries cannot afford access to the material, which
is detrimental to the furthering of medical sciences. In light of this, it should come as
no surprise that \textcquote{till:medical-literature} {Nearly 1 million articles published
by medical journals are downloaded on Sci-Hub each month.} Piracy enables the less
fortunate countries to access valuable medical data that is essential to furthering
medical research for the human race. In such a specific case as this, it should not be
controversial to conclude that piracy is a good thing.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy allows equal access to information
  \item \textcquote{barlow:wine}{I am not comfortable with a model which will restrict inquiry to the wealthy.}

  \item Increased prices are an artificial barrier to access certain
    information. Piracy provides a circumvention to said artificial barrier.
    Piracy gives consumers a way to fight systems they see as
    unfair/censorship. Piracy is a tool of the consumer to control/balance the
    economy~\cite{darnton:pirating-and-publishing, bohannon:everyone}

  \item People pirate medical content.~\cite{till:medical-literature}
    Medical information is valuable to everyone. Having medical information is
    crucial to advancements in medicine, but sometimes the cost is too high.
    The paywalls, in this case, are directly harmful to ends that are
    beneficial to everyone.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Governance}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dissemination of information through means of piracy and torrenting
    gives access to those within areas where Internet shutdowns are commonplace.

  \item Piracy provides a way around an oppressive regime, which are on the
    rise.~\cite{current:jigsaw}

  \item IP laws arbitrarily restrict free speech / invention just because
    someone came up with it first.~\cite[1339]{lemley:faith-based} They are
    based on the assumption that, in doing so, they are encouraging creativity
    (to be first to invent/create), when, in reality, creativity doesn't always
    come first, but may rather be an improvement upon the established. The most
    creative solution is not always the first one. IP laws and restrictions
    block slight innovations upon the existing intellectual property.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Privacy}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy gives you access to cracked versions of software that provide
    more sensible privacy/freedom than what is accessible
    legally.~\cite{stallman:right-to-read}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Arguments Against Piracy}

\subsection{Access to Dangerous/Illegal Content}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy generally enables free/open access to information.

  \item This can be a bad thing for dangerous information that can threaten
    lives/livelihoods.

  \item Piracy would facilitate the spread of dangerous information concerning
    national security, with few tools to mitigate and almost none to stop it.

  \item Piracy provides the means to access content that is questionable/illegal.

  \item When you are pirating, you need to be extremely careful with what you
    are getting. Not all sources are trusted sources; software can be infected
    with malware.

  \item Information and content can be dispersed by bad actors.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Economic}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Businesses are losing money because of acts of piracy.
  \item Piracy is theft, in this sense. It is taking away from employee
    benefits and potential tax revenue for the government.

  \item Piracy takes money from creators and organizations behind content
    creation.~\cite{congress:pirating-the-american-dream}

  \item \textcquote{mrad:effects-of-ip}{According to Gould and Gruben (1996), IPRs protection stimulates economic growth if it is
    accompanied by a policy of trade liberalization. By encouraging initiatives to innovate, IPRs
    protection may influence the economic growth of an open country. Park and Ginarte (1997) found
    that IPRs protection affects economic growth indirectly by stimulating the accumulation of
  factors of production such as physical capital and R\&D capital.}

    Piracy discourages innovation in the capitalist marketplace.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Christian Response}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Drawing distinctions: Paywall to information is different from
    withholding information for sake of security

  \item Paywalls provide the means of living for artists, writers, \&c. Providing
    ways to circumvent these when unnecessary may hinder their livelihoods.

  \item Betterment of mankind as a whole, should not be behind a paywall

  \item Piracy provides an avenue for missionary outreach; piracy provides
    means of secret dissemination within an oppressive regime.

  \item Piracy provides the means for access to content/information without
    much accountability
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Final Thoughts / Responses}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In response to economic argument: Would the pirate have bought the
    product/service in the first place?
\end{enumerate}
