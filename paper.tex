\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background Information}

\begin{displayquote}
  \textins{T}hat ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe,
  for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his
  condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature,
  when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening
  their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and
  have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.
  Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.
  Thomas Jefferson~\cite{barlow:wine}
\end{displayquote}
It is generally accepted that piracy is an illegal activity, but what is often overlooked
is the legitimate role that piracy plays in a variety of contexts. When it comes to
subverting oppressive regimes, for instance, the tools that piracy provides are
indispensable and for protecting the interests of consumers from predatory business
practices, the abilities of piracy are unmatched. Needless to say, with every unregulated
system comes abuse and piracy is no exception. As a Christian, how should one approach
such a tool and how can it be utilized for the betterment of God's kingdom? In the paper
that follows, piracy will be analyzed through a number of lenses, culminating in a
Christian response to this issue. In doing so, the hope is that the reader attains a
fresh, wholistic understanding of the potential value of piracy.
% explain the definition of piracy that we're using for this paper:
% it's not just the act of downloading copyrighted content but it includes the tools that
% are used to accomplish this task.

Before proceeding further into the issue of piracy, it is important to have a grasp of
what piracy means insofar as how this paper interprets it. The dictionary defines piracy
as ``the unauthorized use of another's production, invention, or conception especially in
infringement of a copyright.'' While this covers the technical definition of piracy, this
paper elects to utilize a more wholistic definition. Piracy not only includes the
unauthorized use of someone's work, but it includes the tools and techniques that are
commonly used to accomplish this task such as torrent trackers, VPNs, and torrent clients.

\subsubsection{Intellectual Property}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy on an individual level: Very hard to combat, because you are
    trying to protect things that are immaterial ideas. Ideas flow freely,
    especially in the Internet. Some people might argue that all ideas should
    be free.

  \item While some people might argue that piracy should not be allowed because
    it stifles innovation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Thesis/Argument}

Piracy should not be hastily thrown aside.
Piracy is an excellent tool for disseminating information, services, content,
\&c. that may not have been available any other way.

\section{Arguments For Piracy}

\subsection{Equal Access}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy allows equal access to information
  \item \textcquote{barlow:wine}{I am not comfortable with a model which will restrict inquiry to the wealthy.}

  \item Increased prices are an artificial barrier to access certain
    information. Piracy provides a circumvention to said artificial barrier.
    Piracy gives consumers a way to fight systems they see as
    unfair/censorship. Piracy is a tool of the consumer to control/balance the
    economy~\cite{darnton:pirating-and-publishing, bohannon:everyone}

  \item People pirate medical content.~\cite{till:medical-literature}
    Medical information is valuable to everyone. Having medical information is
    crucial to advancements in medicine, but sometimes the cost is too high.
    The paywalls, in this case, are directly harmful to ends that are
    beneficial to everyone.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Governance}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dissemination of information through means of piracy and torrenting
    gives access to those within areas where Internet shutdowns are commonplace.

  \item Piracy provides a way around an oppressive regime, which are on the
    rise.~\cite{current:jigsaw}

  \item IP laws arbitrarily restrict free speech / invention just because
    someone came up with it first.~\cite[1339]{lemley:faith-based} They are
    based on the assumption that, in doing so, they are encouraging creativity
    (to be first to invent/create), when, in reality, creativity doesn't always
    come first, but may rather be an improvement upon the established. The most
    creative solution is not always the first one. IP laws and restrictions
    block slight innovations upon the existing intellectual property.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Privacy}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Piracy gives you access to cracked versions of software that provide
    more sensible privacy/freedom than what is accessible
    legally.~\cite{stallman:right-to-read}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Arguments Against Piracy}
While piracy enables free access to information and content, it is crucial to
faithfully and charitably explore the potential dangers and economic
implications associated with this practice. The arguments against piracy are
not easy, nor should be, easy to dismiss. This paper will focus mainly on the
ethical and economical concerns that the use of piracy introduces into society.

\subsection{Access to Dangerous/Illegal Content}
Piracy has been associated with unrestricted access to information and
content. As previously discussed, this aspect of piracy provides the means for
those in need to access information that would otherwise be unavailable to them;
similarly, piracy can thus provide avenues to bypass governmental restrictions
on public information. This same benefit, however, becomes a strong argument
against piracy when what is distributed is dangerous or illegal content.

\subsubsection{Criminality of the Seeder and Leecher}
This paper has focused on a more wholistic definition that encompasses
the tools, techniques, motivations, and content, but the motivations and
content that are involved in piracy should not be ignored. Piracy does involve
a form of theft and dissemination of an individual's or organization's
intellectual property. Piracy, thus can and most often does violate laws in
most jurisdictions. Piracy, when it uses torrenting, involves both the
seeder and the leecher (or the uploader and downloader, if not using torrenting).
Depending on the legislation of the country in question, the leecher may or
may not be found guilty of a crime, but this is complicated by the global
context of digital piracy.

In the United States, the downloader/streamer/leecher are generally considered
offenders that could be subject of fines or even criminal charges. The severity
of the penalties of piracy in these cases pose a major argument against the use
of piracy, at least in the United States or nations where the individual
downloading can be found guilty of a crime. ``Fair use'' and statutes of
limitations may alleviate penalties, but repeat offences may also lose one's
favor in these cases.~\cite{felonies.org}

\subsubsection{Malware}
Piracy may openly distribute dangerous illegal content, but arguably the
larger threat is the dangerous content that remains undisclosed. Piracy
circumvents mainline distribution channels that may incorporate secure policies
of data integrity, authenticity, and privacy. Some piracy tools provide
some ways to vet the authenticity of an uploader based on past uploads or based
on the user's relationship with the piracy/torrenting
site\footnote{%
  \href{https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-ThePirateBay-Want-Trusted-VIP-Status-Pink-Green-Skull-See-Here}{ThePirateBay},
  for example provides icons to display whether a user is \emph{Trusted},
  \emph{VIP}, or \emph{Moderator}%
}, but not all sites provide these metrics or warnings for the average end-user.
Instead, the burden is often on the end-user, and it is not unfair to assume
that the average person would not be able to analyze downloaded software for
malware.

% TODO: Add an example of malware distributed via piracy

\subsubsection{Illegal content}
Piracy, as discussed above, provides a way to distribute illegal content. This
content is not always beneficial to society; research articles, art, movies, \&c.
are not the only sorts of content that a pirate may distribute. Piracy opens
the door for questionable and illegal content that may be harmful to society
or national security.

% TODO: Talk about ties to illegal organizations that are involved?

\subsection{Economic}
Piracy, as a theft, also causes real harm to businesses. The act of piracy
does involve stealing and distributing content from creators and organizations
that invested time, money, and effort into the content. In this sense, piracy
is stealing from the individuals' revenue and the government's tax
revenue.~\cite{congress:pirating-the-american-dream}

\textcquote{mrad:effects-of-ip}[.]{%
  According to Gould and Gruben (1996), IPRs protection stimulates economic
  growth if it is accompanied by a policy of trade liberalization. By
  encouraging initiatives to innovate, IPRs protection may influence the
  economic growth of an open country. Park and Ginarte (1997) found that IPRs
  protection affects economic growth indirectly by stimulating the accumulation
  of factors of production such as physical capital and R\&D capital%
}
Piracy, therefore, discourages innovation in the capitalist marketplace.

% TODO
\section{Christian Response}
A Christian response to piracy should honestly take into account both sides of
the debate. As shown above, piracy does have some merit to it. Christians have
to admit that piracy-promoting tools do enable 

% 1 Peter 2:13-17
% Romans 13:4-5

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Drawing distinctions: Paywall to information is different from
    withholding information for sake of security

  \item Paywalls provide the means of living for artists, writers, \&c. Providing
    ways to circumvent these when unnecessary may hinder their livelihoods.

  \item Betterment of mankind as a whole, should not be behind a paywall

  \item Piracy provides an avenue for missionary outreach; piracy provides
    means of secret dissemination within an oppressive regime.

  \item Piracy provides the means for access to content/information without
    much accountability
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Final Thoughts / Responses}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In response to economic argument: Would the pirate have bought the
    product/service in the first place?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{displayquote}
  Of additional concern is the fact that by making \textins{Intellectual Property}
  theft a national security threat without being clear about what actually
  constitutes intellectual property, not only does the U.S. government create a
  new reason for a militarized Internet, but it also sets the stage for companies
  to assert that a range of other activities from file sharing to producing
  counterfeit DVDs threaten national security and require further state
  intervention.~\cite[p. 264]{halbert:agendas}
